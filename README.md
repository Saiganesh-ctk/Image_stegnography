# Image_stegnography
The idea behind image-based Steganography is very simple. Images are composed of digital data (pixels), which describes whatâ€™s inside the picture, usually the colors of all the pixels. Since we know every image is made up of pixels and every pixel contains 3-values (red, green, blue).
Encode the data :
Every byte of data is converted to its 8-bit binary code using ASCII values. Now pixels are read from left to right in a group of 3 containing a total of 9 values. The first 8-values are used to store binary data. The value is made odd if 1 occurs and even if 0 occurs. 
Decode the data :
To decode, three pixels are read at a time, till the last value is odd, which means the message is over. Every 3-pixels contain a binary data, which can be extracted by the same encoding logic. If the value if odd the binary bit is 1 else 0.
